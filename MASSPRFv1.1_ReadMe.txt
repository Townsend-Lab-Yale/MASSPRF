CHECK FILES
Main Files:
Check the files in the sub-folder /massprf-pipeline/, particularly read the README.md file first.

Simulation Data:
For details of simulations for MASS-PRF under three demographic and recombination scenarios, please visit the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Townsend-Lab-Yale/MASSPRF_demo_simulations/

COMPILING COMMANDS
To compile MASS-PRF, ensure there is a bin folder in the same directory as the Makefile. Use one of the following commands to compile:

Using Makefile:

bash
make
Note: Ensure there is a bin folder in the same directory as the Makefile.

Using g++ Directly:

bash
g++ -std=c++0x -O3 -pthread -g MASSprf.cpp PRFCluster.cpp base.cpp -o bin/massprf
EXAMPLE COMMANDS
Ensure that input files are located in the same folder as the massprf executable (typically the ./bin folder).

Run on the Nucleotide FASTA Format
-t 2.5 indicates a user-specified divergence time of 2.5 million years ago (MYA).

bash
./massprf -p Attacin-C_DmDs_pol.fas -d Attacin-C_DmDs_div.fas -o 1 -r 1 -ci_r 1 -ci_m 1 -s 1 -exact 0 -mn 30000 -t 2.5 > output_Attacin-C_MASS-PRF_BIC.txt &
Run on the Consensus Input Format
-ic 1 specifies consensus file format; -sn is required when -ic=1.

bash
./massprf -p consensus_polymorphism.txt -d consensus_divergence.txt -ic 1 -sn 11 -o 1 -r 1 -ci_r 1 -ci_m 1 -s 1 -exact 0 -mn 30000 -t 2.5 > output_consensus_MASS-PRF_BIC.txt &
Run on the Nucleotide FASTA Format with Exhaustive Algorithm

bash
./massprf -p Pol_all_YIR024C.fas -d Div_Spar_YIR024C.fas -o 1 -r 1 -ci_r 1 -ci_m 1 -s 1 -exact 1 -t 5 > output_YIR024C_exhaustive_MACPRF_BIC.txt &
Run on the Nucleotide FASTA Format with Stochastic Algorithm

bash
./massprf -p Pol_all_YIR024C.fas -d Div_Spar_YIR024C.fas -o 1 -r 1 -ci_r 1 -ci_m 1 -s 1 -exact 0 -mn 30000 -t 5 > output_YIR024C_stochastic_MASS-PRF_BIC.txt &
Run with -ssd Option (Site-Specific Divergence Time Calculation)
-ssd should always be used with -s 1; -sn specifies the number of species in polymorphism.

bash
./massprf -p SLC6A5_snps.txt -d Chimp_SLC6A5.txt -o 1 -ic 0 -sn 1000 -ci_m 1 -r 1 -s 1 -ci_r 1 -mn 30000 -ssd -n 0 > testStephen_ssd_out.txt &
Additional Examples with -ssd Option:

bash
./massprf -p Attacin-C_DmDs_pol.fas -d Attacin-C_DmDs_div.fas -o 1 -r 1 -ci_r 1 -ci_m 1 -s 1 -exact 0 -mn 30000 -ssd > output_Attacin-C_MASS-PRF_SSD.txt &

./massprf -p Attacin-C_DmDs_pol.fas -d Attacin-C_DmDs_div.fas -o 1 -r 1 -ci_r 1 -ci_m 1 -s 1 -exact 0 -mn 30000 -ssd > output_Attacin-C_MASS-PRF_SSD_imac.txt &

ADDITIONAL NOTES
-SCL Flag Implementation:
The -SCL flag has been implemented to allow users to compress sequences by units of 3, 6, or 9 nucleotides, thereby reducing computation time. This is advisable for genes longer than 1,000 bp.
Example Usage:

bash
./massprf -p gene_pol.fas -d gene_div.fas -SCL 3 > output_compressed.txt &
Note: Compressing may lead to the loss of information for closely spaced variant sites. Use this option when high precision in those regions is not required or during preliminary analysis.

Compilation Notes:
Ensure that all LookupTable_* files are located in the current working directory when executing the massprf executable. These files are essential for the software to run correctly.

BEST PRACTICES & RECOMMENDATIONS
Selecting the Compression Factor (-SCL):
For genes longer than 1,000 bp, use -SCL 3 to maintain codon alignment while reducing computation time. Be aware that excessive compression may lead to the loss of information for closely spaced variant sites.

Model Selection and Averaging:
Use the default setting -m 0 to enable both model selection and model averaging for more nuanced regional selection estimates.

Confidence Intervals:

Use -ci_r 1 and -ci_m 1 to calculate 95% confidence intervals for selection coefficients and model averaging results.
For larger datasets, consider increasing -mn to 30000 for more reliable stochastic algorithm results.
Parallel Computing:
Due to the computationally intensive nature of MASS-PRF, especially for large-scale genomic studies, it is recommended to run analyses on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. Utilize parallel processing by dividing gene lists into blocks and processing them simultaneously on different nodes or processors to optimize runtime.

Input Data Preparation:
Ensure that input polymorphism and divergence sequences are properly aligned in FASTA format. Use tools like MAFFT, MEGA, or CLUSTAL for sequence alignment. For consensus sequence inputs, use the -ic 1 flag and provide the number of polymorphism sequences with -sn.

Interpreting Results:
Output files contain detailed SSC estimates and confidence intervals. Use statistical software like MATLAB or R to visualize Î³ values across gene domains for better interpretation of selection pressures.
